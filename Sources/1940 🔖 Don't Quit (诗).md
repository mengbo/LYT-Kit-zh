# 1940 - Don't Quit - 埃德加·A·格斯特(Edgar A. Guest)
### Don't Quit
When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,
When the funds are low and the debts are high
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
Life is queer with its twists and turns,
As every one of us sometimes learns,
And many a failure turns about
When he might have won had he stuck it out;
Don't give up though the pace seems slow--
You may succeed with another blow,
Success is failure turned inside out--
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
And you never can tell how close you are,
It may be near when it seems so far;
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit--
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.

- Edgar A. Guest

### 笔记
我有点不喜欢把它放在这里，但当作占位符来显示如何处理 “诗”这一来源还不错。它很短，所以不妨直接把全文粘贴进去。

另外，如果要这里强行建立一个链接，我将向你推荐一个经常发生文中现象的地方： [[心理挤压点]].
